# Ethereum-Based Online Voting System

## Overview

This project implements a secure and transparent online voting system using Ethereum blockchain technology. It leverages the Truffle framework for smart contract development and Ganache for local development and testing. The system enhances security, transparency, and user-friendliness in the voting process.

## Key Features

- **Voter Registration:** Secure registration process for eligible voters.
- **Secure Voting:** User-friendly interface for secure and tamper-proof voting.
- **Candidate Management:** Smart contracts manage candidate information.
- **Real-Time Results:** Ethereum's transparency provides real-time access to election results.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Compile and migrate contracts with Truffle: `truffle compile` and `truffle migrate`.
4. Start Ganache for local blockchain development: `ganache-cli`.
5. Run the front-end interface.
6. Register voters, cast votes, and monitor election progress.
